Hi and welcome!

I am a Computer Science PhD student at <a href='https://www.cics.umass.edu/'>University of Massachusetts Amherst</a> (joined Fall 2021), working under the supervision of <a href='https://cyxiong.com/'>Cindy Xiong Bearfield</a>. I also collaborate with <a href='https://people.cs.umass.edu/~brun/'>Prof. Yuriy Brun</a> and <a href='https://emilywall.github.io/'>Prof. Emily Wall</a>.
My research lies at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction, Human-Centered AI, and Data Visualization. Specifically, I am interested in exploring how language and visual design influence users' perceptions of bias in machine learning systems and impact their trust. My goal is to provide actionable guidelines for designers and developers to create more ethical and transparent ML-driven interfaces, empowering users to engage critically and make more informed decisions. Additionally, I am passionate about making technology more accessible and inclusive.

Before embarking on my PhD journey, I worked for about 2 years after completing my bachelors in Computer Science from <a href='https://lums.edu.pk/'>Lahore University of Management Sciences</a> (Lahore, Pakistan) advised by <a href='https://lums.edu.pk/lums_employee/4407'>Suleman Shahid</a>. During this time, I worked on creating and designing educational games for children (2D and 3D), and as a UX/UI designer for multiple educational institutes.

Apart from work, I am a true foodie i.e., love to try out and cook new dishes, do food photography, and bake in my free time (I make killer brownies, if I may say so myself)! I have a special place for cats in my heart and my favourite form of exercise is swimming. I love to travel and explore new places but you may also find me in my corner reading a book or most likely re-watching the Harry Potter movie series.
