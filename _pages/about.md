Hi and welcome!

I am a Computer Science PhD candidate at <a href='https://www.cics.umass.edu/'>University of Massachusetts Amherst</a>, working with <a href='https://cyxiong.com/'>Dr. Cindy Xiong Bearfield</a> at the intersection of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, **Human-Centered AI**, **Explainable AI (XAI)**, and **Data Visualizations**. 

I use an interdisciplinary approach in my research, drawing from HCI, physcology, and social science. My work spans topics such as **human-AI interactions**, **explainable AI (XAI)**, and **accessibility**. What ties it all together is a commitment to understanding how people navigate and experience technology in complex real-world contexts.

I am a **mixed-methods** researcher, employing innovative human-centered study design methods, from interviews, and surveys, to trust games, speculative + participatory design. My Ph.D. research is focused on Explainable AI (XAI), with the end-goal of making AI more transparent and safe to use. I investigate user trust and the perception of bias in ML models, along with methods to improve user trust by improving model fairness. 

In my accessibility research, I focus on disability-led innovation, especially with blind and low-vision (BLV) communities. Rather than positioning users as subjects or testers, I design studies that give participants the tools, time, and autonomy to define their own problems and create their own solutions.

**I am currently on the job market applying to both industry and academic roles, expected to graduate in Fall 2025.**

Along this journey, I've been fortunate to collaborate with some inspiring researchers including <a href='https://people.cs.umass.edu/~brun/'>Yuriy Brun</a>, <a href='https://emilywall.github.io/'>Emily Wall</a>, <a href='https://www.tableau.com/research/people/vidya-setlur'>Vidya Setlur</a>, <a href='https://arjun010.github.io/'>Arjun Srinivasan</a>, and <a href='https://jhoffswell.github.io/#About'>Jane Hoffswell</a>.

Before embarking on my PhD journey, I worked for about 2 years after completing my bachelors in Computer Science from <a href='https://lums.edu.pk/'>Lahore University of Management Sciences</a> (Lahore, Pakistan) advised by <a href='https://lums.edu.pk/lums_employee/4407'>Suleman Shahid</a>. During this time, I worked on creating and designing educational games for children (2D and 3D), and as a UX/UI designer for educational platforms.

Outside of work, Iâ€™m a big foodie - always on the hunt for new cafes and food spots. I love trying out new recipes, and exploring beautiful hiking spots around the Bay Area. I also enjoy swimming, and spending time with cats. But more often than not, you will find me re-watching the Harry Potter series, Linday Lohan's Parent Trap or just curled up reading a book in some corner.
