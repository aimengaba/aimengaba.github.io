I am a PhD student at UMass Amherst, working at the HCI/VIS lab under the supervision of Dr. Cindy Xiong.
My research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and Data Visualization. Specifically, I am interested in exploring the idea of fairness, trust, and bias in Machine Learning. My interests also lie in making technology that is accessible and inclusive.

I love everything to do with food i.e., cooking, taking pictures, trying out new things. My hobbies include reading, swimming, and stuff.
