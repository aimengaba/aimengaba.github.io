Hi and welcome!

I am a PhD student in Computer Science at University of Massachusetts Amherst, working in the <a href='https://cyxiong.com/visualizaxiong-lab/'>HCI/VIS</a> lab under the supervision of <a href='https://cyxiong.com/'>Dr. Cindy Xiong</a>.
My research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and Data Visualization. Specifically, I am interested in exploring the idea of fairness, trust, and bias in Machine Learning. My interests also lie in making technology that is accessible and inclusive.

Before embarking on this PhD journey, I worked for about 2 years after completing my bachelors in Computer Science advised by Dr. Suleman Shahid. 

I love everything to do with food i.e., cooking, taking pictures, trying out new things. My hobbies include reading, swimming, and stuff.
