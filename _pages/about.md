Hi and welcome!

I'm a Computer Science PhD candidate at <a href='https://www.cics.umass.edu/'>University of Massachusetts Amherst</a>, working with <a href='https://cyxiong.com/'>Dr. Cindy Xiong Bearfield</a> at the intersection of **Human-Computer Interaction**, **Human-Centered AI**, and **Data Visualization**. My research focuses on _Advancing Responsible AI through Human-Centered Evaluation methods_. I use mixed-methods approach to understand people's perception of AI systems and create practical design guidelines that can help make these systems more fair, and inclusive. More specifically, I study how elements like language and visual design shape users’ trust and perceptions of bias, especially for people from gender-diverse and historically marginalized communities.

**I am currectly on the job market applying to both industry and academic roles, expected to graduate in August 2025.**

Along this journey, I've been fortunate to collaborate with some inspiring researchers including <a href='https://people.cs.umass.edu/~brun/'>Yuriy Brun</a>, <a href='https://emilywall.github.io/'>Emily Wall</a>, <a href='https://www.tableau.com/research/people/vidya-setlur'>Vidya Setlur</a>, <a href='https://arjun010.github.io/'>Arjun Srinivasan</a>, and <a href='https://jhoffswell.github.io/#About'>Jane Hoffswell</a>.

Before embarking on my PhD journey, I worked for about 2 years after completing my bachelors in Computer Science from <a href='https://lums.edu.pk/'>Lahore University of Management Sciences</a> (Lahore, Pakistan) advised by <a href='https://lums.edu.pk/lums_employee/4407'>Suleman Shahid</a>. During this time, I worked on creating and designing educational games for children (2D and 3D), and as a UX/UI designer for educational platforms.

Outside of work, I’m a big foodie - always on the hunt for new cafes and food spots. I also occasionally bake (I make really good brownies and chicken bread if I may so myself). I love trying out new recipes, snapping food pictures, and exploring beautiful hiking spots around the Bay Area. I also enjoy swimming, and spending time with cats. But more often than not, you will find me re-watching the Harry Potter series, Linday Lohan's Parent Trap or just curled up reading a book in some corner.
