Hi and welcome!

I am a PhD student studying Computer Science at University of Massachusetts Amherst, working with <a href='https://cyxiong.com/'>Cindy Xiong</a> in the <a href='https://cyxiong.com/visualizaxiong-lab/'>HCI/VIS</a>.
My research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and Data Visualization. Specifically, I am interested in exploring the idea of fairness, trust, and bias in Machine Learning. My interests also lie in making technology that is accessible and inclusive.

Before embarking on my PhD journey, I worked for about 2 years after completing my bachelors in Computer Science advised by <a href='https://lums.edu.pk/lums_employee/4407'>Suleman Shahid</a>. During this time, I worked on creating and designing educational games for children (2D and 3D), and as a UX/UI designer for multiple educational institutes and for women empowerment.

Apart from work, I am a true foodie i.e., love to try out and cook new dishes, do food photography, and bake in my free time (I make killer brownies, if I may say so myself)! I have a special place for cats in my heart and my favourite form of exercise is swimming. I love to travel and explore new places but you will also find me in my corner reading a book or most likely re-watching the Harry Potter movie series.
