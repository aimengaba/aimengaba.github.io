Hi and welcome!

I am a Computer Science PhD candidate at <a href='https://www.cics.umass.edu/'>University of Massachusetts Amherst</a>, working with <a href='https://cyxiong.com/'>Dr. Cindy Xiong Bearfield</a> at the intersection of **Human-Centered AI**, and **Data Visualizations**. 

I use an interdisciplinary approach in my research, drawing from HCI, ML, phychology, and social science. My work spans topics such as **human-AI interactions**, **explainable AI (XAI)**,  **Ethical AI** and **accessibility**. Concretely, I investigate the perception of bias in ML models, along with methods to improve user trust by improving model fairness. In my accessibility research, I focus on disability-led innovation, especially with blind and low-vision (BLV) communities. Rather than positioning users as subjects or testers, I design studies that give participants the tools, time, and autonomy to define their own problems and create their own solutions.
 
What ties my work all together is a commitment to understanding how people navigate and experience technology in complex real-world contexts with the end-goal of making it more transparent and safe to use. I try and use innovative human-centered study design methods, from interviews, and surveys, to trust games, and speculative + participatory design.

I've been fortunate to collaborate with inspiring researchers in the field including <a href='https://people.cs.umass.edu/~brun/'>Yuriy Brun</a>, <a href='https://emilywall.github.io/'>Emily Wall</a>, <a href='https://www.tableau.com/research/people/vidya-setlur'>Vidya Setlur</a>, <a href='https://arjun010.github.io/'>Arjun Srinivasan</a>, and <a href='https://jhoffswell.github.io/#About'>Jane Hoffswell</a>.

Before embarking on my PhD journey, I worked for about 2 years after completing my bachelors in Computer Science from <a href='https://lums.edu.pk/'>Lahore University of Management Sciences</a> (Lahore, Pakistan) advised by <a href='https://lums.edu.pk/lums_employee/4407'>Suleman Shahid</a>. During this time, I worked on creating and designing educational games for children (2D and 3D), and as a UX/UI designer for educational platforms.

Outside of work, I’m a big foodie. I love trying out new cafes and food spots. I like to experiment with cooking and baking too + exploring beautiful hiking spots. I also enjoy swimming, and pickle ball. But more often than not, you will find me re-watching the Harry Potter series, Linday Lohan's Parent Trap or just curled up reading a book in some corner.
