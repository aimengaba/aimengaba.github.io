<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Hi and welcome!</p> <p>I am a PhD student in Computer Science at University of Massachusetts Amherst, working in the <a href="https://cyxiong.com/visualizaxiong-lab/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HCI/VIS</a> lab under the supervision of <a href="https://cyxiong.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Cindy Xiong</a>. My research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and Data Visualization. Specifically, I am interested in exploring the idea of fairness, trust, and bias in Machine Learning. My interests also lie in making technology that is accessible and inclusive.</p> <p>Before embarking on this PhD journey, I worked for about 2 years after completing my bachelors in Computer Science advised by Dr. Suleman Shahid.</p> <p>I love everything to do with food i.e., cooking, taking pictures, trying out new things. My hobbies include reading, swimming, and stuff.</p> </body></html>
