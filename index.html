My research interests lie at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction and Data Visualization. Specifically, I am interested in exploring the idea of fairness, trust, and bias in Machine Learning. My interests also lie in making technology that is accessible and inclusive.</p> <p>I love everything to do with food i.e., cooking, taking pictures, trying out new things.
